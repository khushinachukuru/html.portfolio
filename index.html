    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <h3>Next Gen AI</h3>(Team Member)
    <p>I actively participated in the Next Gen AI campus club, where I contributed significantly to both the Cyber Security
        and Management domains. In the Cyber Security domain, I focused on understanding and mitigating security threats, 
        while in the Management domain, I honed my skills in coordinating team activities and project planning. 
        This experience allowed me to develop a well-rounded perspective on the interplay between technology and leadership.</p>
    
    <h3>SAP Design Studio</h3>(Freelancer)
    <p>I had the opportunity to design and develop the website for SAP Design Studio, an architectural firm. 
    This project involved creating a visually appealing and user-friendly website that effectively showcased the firm’s portfolio 
    and services. I collaborated closely with the team to understand their vision and translate it into a digital presence that 
    reflected the firm's design philosophy.</p>

    <h3>Advaya</h3>(Team Member) 
    <p>I actively participated in the campus club called Advaya , where I showcased my passion for Classical Dance.
     As a member of this club, I contributed to various cultural events and performances, enriching the campus community with 
     traditional dance forms. This experience not only honed my artistic skills but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, 
     discipline, and cultural appreciation.</p>

     <h2>Projects</h2>
     <h3>Penetration Testing Using Metasploit</h3>
     <p>The primary objective of this case study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing a combination of Nmap and Metasploit
        in conducting penetration testing to enhance network security. The methodology involves conducting Nmap scans to identify 
        open ports and services running on target systems. Subsequently, the discovered IP addresses are prioritized based on the 
        severity of identified vulnerabilities and potential impact on network security, Metasploit is then employed to execute 
        exploit modules targeting the identified vulnerabilities, emulating real-world attack scenarios.
     </p>
     <h3>Cure Connect</h3>
     <p>Cure Connect is an innovative diagnostic platform empowering patients to input their symptoms for rapid disease assessment using Python's

        tkinter and Java/CSS/HTML. it analyzes symptoms inputted by patients to provide potential disease diagnoses swiftly. By bridging patient-reported symptoms with medical expertise, Cure Connect streamlines the diagnostic processfor timely healthcare intervention.
        </p>
    <h3>Graphical Representation of Disc Scheduling Algorithms</h3>
    <p>Represented the Disc Scheduling Algorithms in an Operating System, such as CSCAN, CLOOK, FCFS, SSTF, SCAN and LOOK with 
        customised inputs for better visualisation. It was a Python program containing various libraries such as json, PyQt5, QtGui,
         QtCore, uic. It could incorporate more disk scheduling algorithms to create a comprehensive suite such as C-LOOK, N-Step SCAN,
          and variations that are commonly used in real-world scenarios
    </p>
    <h3>Microcontroller Based Furnace Temperature Controller
    </h3>
    <p>A microprocessor-based furnace temperature control system is a sophisticated system designed to control and maintain the 
        temperature inside a furnace for various industrial processes. It involved programming an Arduino Uno board using the 
        Arduino IDE along with an 8085, 8-bit microprocessor.
